                        Want to start playing the game, but you don't want to lose? Or do you 
                        lose every time you play and want to finally experience the glory of winning?

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Setting It Up</h3>

                    <p>
                        Before we start discussing Cave Evil’s ideal strategy, 
                        it’s key to properly set it up. The following 
                        list will catalogue everything you need to play Cave Evil 
                        that’s not contained in the game’s box:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1 or more other players</li>
                        <li>A large table/play space</li>
                        <li>
                            4 cups/containers to hold your resources 
                            (gore, metals, shadow flame) and your rock markers 
                        </li>
                        <li>1 calculator per-person</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        You are almost ready to play, 
                        all you have to do next is take a 
                        read of <a href="http://www.cave-evil.com/CaveEvil_RulesOfWar_2014reprint.pdf">the rule book</a>, and you should be good to start playing.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Drawing Cards</h3>

                    <p>
                        One of the biggest things you have to be conscious 
                        of as a player in Cave Evil is your cards. 
                        Well-crafted squads are the single-most vital component 
                        of the game and will almost completely secure your victory.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The first thing to consider is what deck you will draw 
                        from at the start of your turn, the following table will 
                        list the pros and cons of each deck:
                    </p>

                    <table>
                        <thead>
                            <tr>

                                            Almost no event card’s, 
                                            very little risk of getting 
                                            hindered by drawing from this deck
                                        </li>
    
                                        <li>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Basic Squads</h3>

                    <p>
                        Now that you should have more of an idea on what decks to draw 
                        from to get the cards you need, it's time to talk basic squad strategy! 
                        The subsequent list will show the type of squads you require:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Necromancer squad</li>
                        <li>Excavation squad</li>
                        <li>2 or more attack squads</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Firstly, you have your necromancer squad. 
                        This should be the squad that carries all your 
                        resources and doesn't necessarily need many creatures in 
                        it. Placement-wise, you should keep it protected and far 
                        away from enemy squads. It’s important to do 
                        so as if you lose your necromancer 
                        squad you are almost guaranteed to lose.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, we have the excavation squad. This squad 
                        should have at least 3 excavation power, but it 
                        will be much more useful to have it at 4 excavation power as you 
                        can perform instant excavations. The main purpose 
                        of this squad is not to be strong, so don't worry if 
                        the troops in it aren't. You will be using this squad 
                        to excavate the cave where you can find extra resources 
                        as well as create faster paths to areas on the map. The 
                        squad can also be used to collapse areas of the cave. Collapsing 
                        can be useful if you want to close off tunnels, 
                        but can also be useful for stopping your 
                        opponent’s squads.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Now onto attack squads. These are the most important 
                        squads to build correctly, as a good attack squad can 
                        make or break a game. Generally, you are going to want 
                        to fill these squads with powerful creatures that can 
                        carry and use items. The more items they can carry and 
                        use, the better, as items can turn a good squad into a 
                        great squad. With that being said, it’s also very critical 
                        to consider the abilities your creatures have. 
                        As an example, take the hellion cards. Stat-wise, they aren't 
                        that great, but their ability to be in a squad of 
                        two other hellions transforms them into an 
                        exceptional card to form your attack squad around.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Advanced Squads</h3>

                    <p>
                        Onto some more advanced squads. These squads are completely optional but can prove to be quite 
                        useful if you find the right cards for them. These squads are:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Ranged squads</li>
                        <li>Resource collection squads</li>
                        <li>Throwaway squads</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Firstly, ranged squads. Whilst they aren't necessary 
                        they are a great way to pick off your enemies squads.  
                        There is no risk in attempting a ranged attack because your 
                        ranged squad can’t be destroyed unless they’re in an 
                        adjacent hex with the opponent's squad. Positioning 
                        wise, you are going to want to keep them in line of sight 
                        with the enemy because, unless they have a special ability 
                        that says otherwise, they will not be able to attack if they aren't. 
                        You should also keep the squad positioned on the very edge of what 
                        their ranged-attack hex range allows as the closer you get to 
                        the enemy squad the more likley you squad will be destroyed.
                    </p>

                        Next, we have the resource collection squad. Whilst most of the 
                        time you should be perfectly fine collecting resources with your 
                        regular squads, every once in a while there might be something that 
                        pops in across the map that you really want. That’s where this 
                        squad comes in. Forget about strength, this squad is purely for 
                        movement speed. Get in and get out as fast as you can so you 
                        can return the resources to your necromancer squad. The major thing 
                        to consider when creating this squad is that the 
                        creatures must have the ability to carry items, if they don't, you are 
                        cutting out one of the major resources you can collect from the map.

                        Finally, we have throwaway squads. It’s entirely possible 
                        that you could go a whole game without finding a single 
                        creature that would fit in a squad like this. That being 
                        said, it’s important to know how to use these types of creatures 
                        if you end up drawing them, as they can 
                        massively disadvantage your opponent. The type of creatures 
                        I’m talking about are the ones with on-death abilities that 
                        have negative effects on the enemy squads. For the most part, 
                        these creatures don't work in any other squads, as they’re 
                        normally weak stat-wise. So their main purpose is to be placed 
                        into no win situations, all by themselves, and have them get destroyed 
                        so they can use their 
                        on-death abilities to disadvantage the enemy squad, 
                        making it easier for your others squads to finish the job.
