                        Like it or hate it, noise music is one of the most 
                        interesting musical genres to date, some may say it's 
                        not even music, where others would defend it with their 
                        life. Ever wonder how we got from vocal music and classical 
                        all the way to noise? Well, in this article we will discuss 
                        the condensed history of the genre: the early years, Japanese noise, 
                        European noise, the spread of noise and modern noise.

                            “Noise music takes everything that we think 
                            we like about music and flips it on its head, 
                            creating some totally inaccessible and un-listenable sounds. 
                            So, why does it exist? And why are so many 
                            people obsessed with it?” - Jonathan Snipes  
                        </i>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Early Years</h3>

                    <p>
                        Whilst it's nearly impossible to pinpoint who started the genre, 
                        Italian painter <span class="bold">Luigi Russolo</span> is considered among one of the first. 
                        His article in 1913, titled <a href="http://www.artype.de/Sammlung/pdf/russolo_noise.pdf">The Art of Noise</a>, theorized that in an 
                        age of machinery, industrial noises would seep into all of our music. 
                        At the time there were no instruments that could fulfill his artistic 
                        vision so, in the following year, Russolo developed 
                        instruments he called the <span class="bold">Intonarumori</span>. 
                        The Intonarumori could create the following sounds and more: 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Roars</li>
                        <li>Explosions</li>
                        <li>Whistles</li>
                        <li>Creaking</li> 
                        <li>Screeching</li> 
                    </ul>

                        Russolo’s inventions were premiered in futurist concerts, 
                        an early 20th-century modern art movement. He continued to 
                        develop his instruments until they were all destroyed in the 
                        Paris bombings of World War II. Luckily, in 2009, composer 
                        Luciano Chessa was able to recreate the instruments and, in a sense, 
                        preserve the musical history that had been previously lost for nearly a century. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You could also look to avant-garde composer <span class="bold">John Cage</span> who began to experiment 
                        with unusual compositions and instruments in the late 1930s and had a much 
                        larger influence on the experimental music landscape, 
                        with multiple experimental artists directly citing him as an influence. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        His dive into the unorthodox began with his modified piano, 
                        where he put objects on the piano's string to create percussive 
                        sounds. He also delved into the realm of tape recorders, record 
                        players and radio. Using these devices, he began to 
                        include nonmusical sounds in his works, 
                        going as far as composing for the tape recorder.

                        Cage, J (1952) Williams Mix

                    <p>
                        All of this led to him creating the concept of <span class="bold">indeterminism</span> 
                        which he used in his compositions. Indeterminism meant that there was 
                        a level of randomness in his work. He accomplished that by using:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Unspecified instruments</li> 
                        <li>Unspecified amount of performers</li> 
                        <li>Unspecified duration of notes</li>
                        <li>Inexact notation</li> 
                        <li>Improvisation from players</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        This concept inspired the creation of some of his most 
                        polarizing pieces such as the <i>Imaginary Places</i> series, 
                        which was played using a combination of the following:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Randomly tuned radios</li>
                        <li>Turntables</li>
                        <li>Tape recorders</li>
                        <li>Conventional instruments</li>  
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Whilst the series lacked the distortion that became common 
                        with noise music, it has the same attitude that the genre would 
                        later display, especially in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-3iLnXV90s">Imaginary Places No 1</a>, which contained prolonged 
                        high-pitched tones that are at times uncomfortable to listen to.

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Japanese Noise</h3>
                    <p>
                        In the 1960s came the first “collective musical improvisation group”, called 
                        <span class="bold">Group Ongaku</span>. Group Ongaku was composed 
                        of six students from Tokyo Nation University of Fine Arts & Music 
                        and became the first group to bring Noise to Japan, releasing two tapes - 
                        “Automatism” and “Object”. These tapes included the sounds of vacuum 
                        cleaners, radio static, kitchenware and were beyond 
                        influential for the noise scene, garnering them a loyal following.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That being said, Group Ongaku was only the start of the avalanche 
                        of sound known as noise music that would fall upon Japan. 
                        In the following years, many bustling noise scenes would 
                        appear all across Japan, all independent to each other yet simultaneous. 
                        The two major cities where the noise scenes thrived were: 
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <span class="bold">Osaka</span>, where punk and hardcore bands began to delve 
                            into the noisier aspects of their sound.
                        </li> 

                        <li>
                            <span class="bold">Tokyo</span>, where the “king” of noise music <span class="bold">Akita Masami</span> 
                            better known as <span class="bold">Merzbow</span> and other solo artists began 
                            to mess around with any cheap sound machines such as 
                            broken instruments, tape recorders and more.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                        These artists all took influence from many genres, some were more 
                        interested in free jazz, others took from the modernist movements 
                        (such as futurism). But, what they all still had in common was 
                        the urge to make loud, unique, and, most of all, uncompromising music. 
                    </p>

                    <p>This is shown in the many infamous concert stories which are recited in the following list:</p>

                    <p>
                        1976, London, England, marks the year 
                        <span class="bold">Industrial Records</span> was created as well as 
                        the birth of the industrial genre. Industrial 
                        Records gave many electronic, experimental and 
                        proto-noise artists a platform to release their avant-garde ideas. 
                        These artists included the likes of:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Throbbing Gristle</li>
                        <li>Cabaret Voltaire</li>
                        <li>Mont Cazazza</li>
                        <li>The Leather Nun</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Industrial Records would have an impact on a whole 
                        generation of industrial musicians from 1976 - 1982. 
                        This era of industrial music was known as first-wave 
                        industrial and its proto-noise ideas 
                        came to influence a genre known as <span class="bold">power electronics</span>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The term power electronics was coined by musician <span class="bold">William Bennett</span>, 
                        a member of <span class="bold">Whitehouse</span>, the first band to release music under said 
                        genre. Power electronics is characterized by its loud use of synthesizers, 
                        screeching high-end, and occasional harsh vocals. The lyrics often 
                        included taboo topics, sometimes presented in a 
                        thought-provoking manner, but most of the time used only to shock.

                        In the late 1980s <span class="bold">death industrial</span> emerged from 
                        the fairly active power electronics scene. Pioneered 
                        by groups such as Ramleh from England, Genocide Organ 
                        from Germany and Mz.412 from Sweden. Death industrial 
                        took power electronics and replaced the harsh edge with a calmer dark ambient 
                        influence while still keeping the harsh vocals.

                    <p>In comparison to Japan’s noise there are two major differences:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The noise music in Europe was much more 
                            structured than the freer sound experiments of Japan.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            The live performances, while still extreme in Europe, 
                            could not be compared to the insane live performances in Japan. 
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">The Spread of Noise</h3>

                    <p>
                        Up until this point, the noise scenes in Japan and 
                        Europe, whilst they were popular enough among the 
                        people “in the know”, never left their respective 
                        countries. But that all changed in the late 1980s 
                        when Merzbow began to tour outside of Japan. In 1988 
                        he toured Russia, 1989 he toured the Netherlands and 
                        France, and in 1990 he made his way to America. Luckily 
                        for the genre, the tours were a major success and they 
                        opened up a sense of communication between musicians, 
                        creating a collaborative atmosphere that was near 
                        non-existent before. The tours also spread the love for 
                        the genre and inspired artists to dive into it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You could also attribute the spread of the genre to the mail-order 
                        system Merzbow set up to disperse his cassette recordings. This system would later be adapted by 
                        independent record labels to distribute their artist’s work. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        These independent record labels also released noise compilations 
                        that featured noise from Japan and Europe. These compilations 
                        not only brought in new listeners but exposed them to so many 
                        different styles of noise. This exposure would transform the 
                        next generation of noise music as the artists making it would be 
                        taking influence from all many different styles of noise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The traction of the genre would increase even more 
                        in the following years with the popularity of the 
                        Internet. All of a sudden people didn’t have to pay 
                        to distribute their music nor to consume the music of 
                        other artists. It was also through the internet 
                        that artists could collaborate, get feedback and find others 
                        that were interested in the genre via chat rooms.

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Modern Noise</h3>

                    <p>
                        Since the start of the 2000s, noise music has been 
                        constantly reaching new levels of popularity. It has an 
                        average of 1,468 releases in rate your music database per year in the 2010s, 
                        and the number of releases is on a continuous incline.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond that, Luigi Russolo’s predictions seem to be 
                        gradually coming true. Many artists have been 
                        including noise elements in other genres. 
                        Some of the genres are listed in the following:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Industrial Hip-Hop</li>
                        <li>Noise Pop</li>
                        <li>Noise Rock</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Now, these artists may not be chart-topping, but they 
                        have gained an immense following which is previously 
                        unheard of for the genre. As an example, take a look 
                        at the group clipping.. This group mixes straightforward 
                        hip-hop elements with harsh noise, musique concrète, 
                        power electronics, field recordings and much more. 
                        They have nearly 240,000 listeners on Spotify and 
                        managed to have a song go viral on TikTok last year.

                        Over the course of this article, we covered the early years of noise, 
                        the Japanese and European noise scenes, the spread of noise and we took a 
                        look at the state of noise now. If you are wanting to check out the genre 
                        I recommend you lend an ear to the Spotify-made
