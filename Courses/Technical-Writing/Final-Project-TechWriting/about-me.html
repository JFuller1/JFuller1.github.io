                        <p>
                            Hi, my name is Jaeden Fuller, I live in Winnipeg, Manitoba and 
                            I'm a student at <span class="bold">Manitoba Institute of Trades & Technology (MITT)</span>. 
                            At MITT, I'm attending the Software Development Program. 
                            I chose to take this course because I've always had an interest in 
                            programming as well as web design and I really want to enhance my 
                            skills in both topics so I can make something that I am 
                            truly proud of.
                        </p>
        
                        <div class="image-side">
                            <div>
                                <p>
                                    When I’m not making music I’m most likely participating in my other hobby, 
                                    which is creating art. I started doodling at a young age and it has just stuck with me all my life. 
                                    When I started to take it a bit more seriously at around the age of 10 I was drawing rather 
                                    concrete ideas with pencil and pen but I’ve found that as time has gone by my style has drifted more 
                                    and more into the abstract. At the moment I love doing collages but primarily do minimalistic colour 
                                    work, which was initially inspired by the work of Bill Sienkiewicz. 
                                </p> 

                                <p>
                                    One of the things I am most passionate about is music; 
                                    I love exploring its many wonderful genres and I’m constantly 
                                    trying to broaden my taste via exploring tons of different styles. 
                                    My favourite kind of music has to be the stuff that sounds like nothing I have ever heard before. 
                                    I also like to dabble in making music myself during my free time. 
                                    The music I make includes but is not limited to plunderphonics, ambient and noise.
