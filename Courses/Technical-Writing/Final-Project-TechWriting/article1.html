                        Have you ever opened up a website and noticed that lock icon that appears in the address bar, right before the URL, 
                        but never really knew what it did? If so, you’ve come to the right post! 
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Secure Socket Layer?</h3>

                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">Secure Socket Layer (SSL)</span> is a <a href="#networkSec">network security protocol</a> that was 
                        first developed in 1995 by a company called <span class="bold">Netscape</span>. The purpose 
                        of SSL was to ensure safe communication over the internet via <a href="#encryption">encryption</a> 
                        & <a href="#authentication">authentication</a>. Although, SSL had many security flaws. That’s why in 
                        1999 SSL was replaced by <span class="bold">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</span>, the name change 
                        happened because the <span class="bold">Internet Engineering Task Force</span> (An international community 
                        of web experts with the goal of furthering the operation of the Internet) was 
                        taking over development of the protocol. Currently, TLS is the network security protocol used by most people, 
                        with the newest version, TLS 1.3, being released in August 2018.  
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="sub-heading">Am I Using It?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Yes! You might not know it, but every time you open a webpage and 
                        see that lock icon in the address bar that means you are 
                        using <span class="bold">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)</span> which in fact 
                        uses TLS/SSL to authenticate the website and to encrypt all the data you send. 
                        If you don't see that lock icon in the address bar it 
                        means you are only using <span class="bold">Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</span>. 
                    </p>

                    <h4 class="imageTitle">Lock Icon</h4>
                    <hr class="imagehrTop">
                    <img src="assets/img/article2-img.png" style="width: 100%;">
                    <hr class="imagehrBottom">

                    <p>
                        HTTP isn't necessarily dangerous, you can still watch videos or read articles on 
                        websites that use it, but you don't want to input any sensitive information in websites 
                        that only use it. The reason being that HTTP has <span class="bold">no encryption</span> and your information 
                        would be sent to the server in <a href="#plain">plain text</a> and extremely easy for anyone to steal.
                    </p>
